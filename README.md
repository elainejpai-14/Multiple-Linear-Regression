- The 1.03.+Dummies.csv file containing the data used to fit the regression model
- The .ipynb file with the code

## Requirements

To run the notebook, install the following Python libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels
```
## How to Use
### 1. Clone the repository or navigate to the notebook location
git clone https://github.com/elainejpai-14/Multiple-Linear-Regression.git
